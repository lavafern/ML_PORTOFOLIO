# Xcompany data analysis

Xcompany is a company that wants its data to be analyzed, and I will use data analysis techniques to find insights from the company.


# ERD
The data table here is still messy and needs to be cleaned. 
I will use KNN imputer to fill in the missing values and add a "campaign name" column to the Transaksi table.

# Get the insight
After the data visualized using tableau, I found out :

1. In January, the company experienced a significant increase in sales, reaching its peak in March. Furthermore, from March to July, the company's sales remained stable despite a slight decrease. However, in August, there was a drastic drop in sales. Based on the pattern, this can be attributed to the fact that the company did not carry out any marketing campaigns in August. We should do the marketing campaign so the company potentially lead to higher profits in the long run.

2. In the past 8 months, Product E has achieved outstanding performance by becoming the best-selling product, while Product A has lower sales. We need to evaluate and identify the issues causing Product A to have the worst sales performance.
